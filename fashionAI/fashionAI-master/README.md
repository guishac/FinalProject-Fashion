## About The Project
In this project we created a model using Tensorflow. We chose to classify images on clothing items. We pulled images from the web through web scraping and also from a fashion dataset. From there we created a flask to deploy to our model from AWS S3 and deployed to heroku. 
 
### Built With
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
